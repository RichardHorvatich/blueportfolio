Ive made three tutorials. However this is the first one I have made from scratch, almost every line my own(except most of the javascript).
I really enjoyed this project, it felt like making music. 

The projects section needs 3 more projects, which I plan to work on in the next week or so. They will all be HTML emails. 
The contact section isnt live currently. Will fix soon.
